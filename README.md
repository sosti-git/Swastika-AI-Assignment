Intelligence:
Intelligence is the ability to reason, ability to understand, ability to create, ability to learn from experience and ability to plan and execute complex task.

Artificial Intelligence:
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

AI Perspectives
1. Acting and Thinking humanly:
Acting Humanly:
“The study of how to make computer do things at which, at the moment, people are better.” (Rich and Knight, 1991) Acting humanly is also known as "The Turing Test Approach".The Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950) was designed to convince the people that whether a particular machine can think or not. He suggested a test based on indistinguishability from undeniably intelligent entities- human beings. The test involves an interrogator who interacts with one human and one machine. Within a given time the interrogator has to find out which of the two the human is, and which one the machine.

The computer passes the test if a human interrogator after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written response come from human or not. To pass a Turing test, a computer must have following capabilities:  Natural Language Processing: Must be able to communicate successfully in English  Knowledge representation: To store what it knows and hears.  Automated reasoning: Answer the Questions based on the stored information.  Machine learning: Must be able to adapt in new circumstances.

Turing test avoid the physical interaction with human interrogator. Physical simulation of human beings is not necessary for testing the intelligence

The total Turing test includes video signals and manipulation capability so that the interrogator can test the subject’s perceptual abilities and object manipulation ability. To pass the total Turing test computer must have following additional capabilities:  Computer Vision: To perceive objects  Robotics: To manipulate objects and move

Thinking Humanly:
“The exciting new effort to make computers think…..machine with minds, in the full and literal sense.” (Haugeland, 1985) Thinking Humanly is also known as "Cognitive Modelling Approach". Cognition means the action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience and senses.To make a machine that think like human brain, scientific theories of internal brain activities (cognitive model) are required.There are two ways to do this: – through introspection: catch our thoughts while they go by – through psychological experiments. Once we have precise theory of mind, it is possible to express the theory as a computer program. The field of cognitive science brings together computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to try to construct precise and testable theories of the workings of the human mind.

2. Acting and Thinking rationally:
Acting Rationally:
“Computational Intelligence is the study of the design of intelligent agents.” (Poole et al., 1998) Acting Rationally is also known as "The Rational Agent Approach".Agent is something that acts. Computer agent is expected to have following attributes:

Autonomous control  Perceiving their environment  Persisting over a prolonged period of time  Adapting to change  And capable of taking on another’s goal Rational behavior means doing the right thing. The right thing is that which is expected to maximize goal achievement, given the available information. Rational Agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome. In this approach the emphasis is given to correct inferences.One way to act rationally is to reason logically to the conclusion and act on that conclusion. On the other hand there are also some ways of acting rationally that can not be said to involve inference. For Example, recoiling from a host stove is a reflex action that is usually more successful than a slower action taken after careful deliberation.
Advantages:  It is more general than laws of thought approach, because correct inference is just one of several mechanisms for achieving rationality.  It is more amenable to scientific development than are approaches based on human behavior or human thought because the standard of rationality is clearly defined and completely general.

Thinking Rationally:
"The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act.” (Winston, 1992) Thinking Rationally is also known as "The Laws of Thought Approach". Aristotal was one of the first who attempt to codify the right thinking that is irrefutable reasoning process. He gave Syllogisms that always yielded correct conclusion when correct premises are given. For example:

Ram is a man

Man is mortal

Ram is mortal

Let p(x) => x is man q(x) => x is mortal then above statement can be written as p(x) => q(x) Man is mortal p(Ram) Ram is man Then from modus ponens q(x) ia also true. That is Ram is mortal

Problems: It is not easy to take informal knowledge and state in the formal terms required by logical notation, particularly when knowledge is not 100% certain.Solving problem principally is different from doing it in practice. Even problems withcertain dozens of fact may exhaust the computational resources of any computer unless it has some guidance as which reasoning step to try first.

History of AI:
–1943: Warren Mc Culloch and Walter Pitts: a model of artificial boolean neurons to perform computations.

First steps toward connectionist computation and learning (Hebbian learning). Marvin Minsky and Dann Edmonds (1951) constructed the first neural network computer – 1950: Alan Turing’s “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” First complete vision of AI.

The birth of AI(1956)

Dartmouth Workshop bringing together top minds on automata theory, neural nets and the study of intelligence. – Allen Newell and Herbert Simon: The logic theorist (first nonnumeric thinking program used for theorem proving) – For the next 20 years the field was dominated by these participants.
Collapse in AI research (1966 - 1973) – Progress was slower than expected. – Unrealistic predictions. – Some systems lacked scalability. – Combinatorial explosion in search. – Fundamental limitations on techniques and representations. – Minsky and Papert (1969) Perceptrons.

AI revival through knowledge-based systems (1969-1970): – General-purpose vs. domain specific

E.g. the DENDRAL project (Buchanan et al. 1969) First successful knowledge intensive system. – Expert systems
MYCIN to diagnose blood infections (Feigenbaum et al.)
Introduction of uncertainty in reasoning. – Increase in knowledge representation research.
Logic, frames, semantic nets, …
AI becomes an industry (1980 - present) – R1 at DEC (McDermott, 1982) – Fifth generation project in Japan (1981) – American response … Puts an end to the AI winter.

Connectionist revival (1986 - present): (Return of Neural Network) – Parallel distributed processing (RumelHart and McClelland, 1986); backprop.

AI becomes a science (1987 - present) – In speech recognition: hidden markov models – In neural networks – In uncertain reasoning and expert systems: Bayesian network formalism

The emergence of intelligent agents (1995 - present) – The whole agent problem: “How does an agent act/behave embedded in real environments with continuous sensory inputs”

Applications of AI:
AI has been dominant in various fields such as −

Gaming − AI plays crucial role in strategic games such as chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, etc., where machine can think of large number of possible positions based on heuristic knowledge.

Natural Language Processing − It is possible to interact with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.

Expert Systems − There are some applications which integrate machine, software, and special information to impart reasoning and advising. They provide explanation and advice to the users.

Vision Systems − These systems understand, interpret, and comprehend visual input on the computer. For example,

A spying aeroplane takes photographs, which are used to figure out spatial information or map of the areas.

Doctors use clinical expert system to diagnose the patient.

Police use computer software that can recognize the face of criminal with the stored portrait made by forensic artist.

Speech Recognition − Some intelligent systems are capable of hearing and comprehending the language in terms of sentences and their meanings while a human talks to it. It can handle different accents, slang words, noise in the background, change in human’s noise due to cold, etc.

Handwriting Recognition − The handwriting recognition software reads the text written on paper by a pen or on screen by a stylus. It can recognize the shapes of the letters and convert it into editable text.

Intelligent Robots − Robots are able to perform the tasks given by a human. They have sensors to detect physical data from the real world such as light, heat, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure. They have efficient processors, multiple sensors and huge memory, to exhibit intelligence. In addition, they are capable of learning from their mistakes and they can adapt to the new environment.
